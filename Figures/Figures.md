# Figures

Figure 1. Conceptual hierarchy of individual movement spanning (1) fine, (2) intermediate, and (3) coarse time and space scales. Each section (Displacement, Dispersal, Migration) represents the common processes at each scale and the width and height represent the time and space scale, respectively. The central individual unit _i_ with its internal state and dynamic energy budget DEB fluctuates with basic energy requirements, costs, and gains $(i_{DEB})$, ultimately linked to individual fitness. At each scale, thicker, coloured arrows represent emerging processes, boxes represent the end processes from movement, and plus signs denote dominant complementary behaviours or processes. 

Figure 2. Stylised conceptual diagram of direct and indirect movement costs in time and space across the individual life cycle. Circles represent individual body mass of offspring, juvenile, and adult. Direct movement costs (A, green) form a proportion of somatic maintenance costs (B, blue) across growth. Indirect movement costs (C, pink) change as the individual interacts with its environment over time due to increasing movement trade-offs associated with different behaviour, such as foraging, mating, and defending. Hatched polygon represents points in time and space where the individual may anticipate how indirect movement costs influence performance, i.e. consciously change strategy in response to previous maladaptive behaviour, where $E^P_H$ signifies the shift in maturity from offspring to juvenile and the onset of adaptive movement, e.g. dispersal events. Numbers represent different behavioural events (described in main text).  

Figure 3. Examples of contrasting landscape and habitat structures that animals must negotiate in space and time. Top: Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data of an arid, terrestrial environment in South Australia (139º21'E, 33º55'S) highlighting A) large vegetation in contrast to B) available small vegetation for the same site that acts as available refuges for animals throughout the day. Middle: Examples of simulated model landscapes showing C) low and D) high resource (food and shade) density to emulate the conditions seen in A) and B). Insets show simulated animal movement paths using a spatial movement framework that incorporates the $i_{DEB}$ primer. Bottom: Field images of the study site in A) and B) showing the visible differences between E) low and F) high resource density within a habitat. 

Figure 4. Schematic of data and model inputs of the IDEBM model. Examples of weather data: monthly to annual temperatures microclimate; Microclimate: local solar and infrared radiation temperature, ground and air temperature (Table 4); DEB model: See Tables 3 and 6; Heat budget model: See Table 4; Habitat data: food and shade patches (Table 5). The DEB and heat budget models update with the time steps of the decision-making IBM to form feedback loops. All weather and habitat data are modelled on the sleepy lizard habitat (139º21'E, 33º55'S). Animal data are for the adult sleepy lizard.  

Figure 5. Schematic of decision-making IBM simulation runs. Solid boxes are processes, dashed boxes are individual decisions, and ellipses are individual actions. Searching refers to either searching for food, shade, or socialising, depending on the current thermal or metabolic state or movement strategy of the animal. Hungry refers to whether the gut fullness threshold is <75%.  

Figure 6. (A) Distributions of home range area (km^2^) of real (pink) and seeded simulated optimising (orange) and satisficing (blue) movement strategies under dense resource distribution (food and shade). Home range polygons in space showing overlap of seeded simulated (B) satisficing and (C) optimising individuals and (D) real individuals. Home ranges in (D) appear more scattered due to different starting locations of real animals, whereas (B) and (C) have seeded starting locations in the centre of the landscape. The vegetation layer in (D) is generated from LIDAR data of the habitat site, showing the thermal mosaic of the landscape.

Figure 7. Activity budget for all optimising and satisficing animals throughout the breeding season showing proportion of time spent (A) feeding, (B) searching, and (C) resting, as well as (D) proportion of number of transitions between activity states. Radius = time spent in activity state; circumference = days throughout the breeding season. Black arrows indicate a 5-day period where environmental conditions were not conducive to activity, so animals spent this time resting in shade.  

Figure 8. Movement path and home ranges of real versus simulated sleepy lizards. (A) Individual #11885, a real sleepy lizard showing active movement and (B) individual #11533, a real sleepy lizard showing passive movement, throughout the breeding season. (C) A random simulated optimising individual representing the maximum potential movement and (D) a random simulated satisficing individual representing the minimum movement necessary throughout the breeding season based on its physiological limits. (C–D) green = food patches, black = shade patches, and polygons represent home ranges. Patch size in simulations represents time elapsed on patch.  

Figure 9. Energetic outputs showing differences in maximum (optimising) and minimum (satisficing) potential movement. (A) Cumulative movement costs (kJ) for a random simulated optimising (orange) and satisficing (blue) individual throughout the breeding season. (B) Difference in mean structural volume (g^–1^ cm^3^; green), wet mass storage (g; blue), converted food mass (g; black), and reproductive organ wet mass (g; pink) between optimising and satisficing movement strategies throughout the breeding season.
